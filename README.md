## 🤓 Motivation
Funny enough, [Christian Dezha](https://github.com/kekedezha) and I created this project to make up for my serious lack of gift giving skills. 

Both transitioning over to software development, we thought it would be a great idea to have AI help us out with gift ideas as we expand and grow our knowledge in software engineering. This project helped us explore and learn both the Front-End and Back-End side of software/app development and hopefully helps others when it comes to gift giving! 

## 🛠️ Main Technologies
Front-End: 
  - `HTML`
  - `CSS`
  - `JavaScript`
  - `React`
  - `Firebase`
  - `Vite`
  
Back-End: Visit [GifFairy-BE](https://github.com/kekedezha/GiftFairy-BE)

## 💡 Key Features
- AI generated gift ideas, with direct link to Amazon
- Amazon affiliate link
- Responsive Web Design
- Write-in your own category selections for better tailored gift ideas 

## 💻 Working Integration/Improvements

**Working Integration:**
  - User Authentication 
  - Profile view for history of gift ideas generated

**Improvements**
  - Add a button where user can choose between Amazon or Etsy. Current version is tailored towards items you can purchase on Amazon
  - Transition web-app to mobile app and add to app store for both Apple and Andriod
  - Integrate AWS for language selection
## 🪲 Bugs

- User can select a 'write-in you own', leave it blank and proceed to the next page, causing the POST request to OpenAI to fail.
- Refreshing browser on anything but the landing page causes netlify to display "Page Not Found"

## 📈 Overall Growth:

Each part of this project helped me understand more about building apps, managing complex information, and improving user experience. It was more than just making a web-app. It was about solving problems, learning new things, and improving my skills for future work.
